DevOps Journey

Here is everything I have learned and created in this journey.

Shell Scripts
1) `gen_folder_and_2_files.sh`

A shell script that creates a new directory and automatically generates two files inside it.

Description:
This script takes a folder name as input, creates that folder, and then creates two empty files within it.
